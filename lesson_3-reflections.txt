When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Q1: If I need to edit something quickly and I am not in my native computer. But if it's code I suggest testing the code first.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling manually will be a safe way to know that what you are doing on your local computer will not be affected by what others are doing on the repository on GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    When I want to use someone else's public repository to use on my project but I do not want to edit their repository or have no permission to edit their repository because I have no idea what's inside that repository then I would do fork.

    If I want to copy the repository at Github to my local repository then I would use clone.

    If I want to try something and would not like my master repository to be affected then I would use branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
